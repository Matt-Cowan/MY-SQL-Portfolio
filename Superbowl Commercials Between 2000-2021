This files contains queries/ answers for various questions regarding Superbowl Commercials for 10 popular brands between 2000-2021.

The first question I wanted to answer was which brand had the most commercials during this sample data. In order to work it out, I quiered the following & it returned 'Bud light'.

SELECT TOP 1 Brand, COUNT(*) AS NumCommercials
FROM dbo.[SuperBowl Commercials Master File]
GROUP BY Brand
ORDER BY NumCommercials DESC;

I wanted to find out which commercial whas the least popular during this time. So I quiered:

SELECT TOP 1 Brand, 
             Year,
             Youtube_Views,
             Youtube_Likes
FROM dbo.[SuperBowl Commercials Master File]
ORDER BY Youtube_Views ASC, Youtube_Likes ASC;

How to find out the average length per commercial per year ?

SELECT AVG(Length) AS AvgLength
FROM dbo.[SuperBowl Commercials Master File]
WHERE Year = 2006; -- Insert different year here.

Next, which brand(s) have had the highest success using commercials (youtube hits etc)

SELECT Brand, SUM(Youtube_Views) AS TotalViews
FROM dbo.[SuperBowl Commercials Master File]
GROUP BY Brand
ORDER BY TotalViews DESC;

This brought back 'Doritos' from 2012 being the brand with the highest hits.

Which commercial cost the most to produce ?


SELECT TOP 1 Brand, 
             Year, 
             Estimated_Cost
FROM dbo.[SuperBowl Commercials Master File]
ORDER BY Estimated_Cost DESC;


Now I wanted to see what was the cheapest commercial to produce but it produced the most hits. 

SELECT TOP 1 Brand, 
             Year, 
             Estimated_Cost, 
             Youtube_Views
FROM dbo.[SuperBowl Commercials Master File]
ORDER BY (Youtube_Views/Estimated_Cost) DESC;

Finally, I wanted to work out what the average cost was per commercial between 2000-2021:

SELECT AVG(Estimated_Cost) AS AverageCost
FROM dbo.[SuperBowl Commercials Master File]
WHERE Year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2021;

I hope you enjoyed.
