This file showcases queries regarding a dataset containing NYC traffic accidents in 2020 (Jan-Aug)

I wanted to first break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. Here's how I found out:

SELECT 
  DATEPART(weekday, CRASH_DATE) AS DayOfWeek,
  DATEPART(hour, CRASH_TIME) AS HourOfDay,
  COUNT(*) AS AccidentFrequency
FROM dbo.[NYC Accidents 2020]
GROUP BY DATEPART(weekday, CRASH_DATE), DATEPART(hour, CRASH_TIME)
ORDER BY AccidentFrequency DESC

Are there specific locations with higher accident rates?

SELECT 
  BOROUGH,
  COUNT(*) AS AccidentCount
FROM dbo.[NYC Accidents 2020]
WHERE BOROUGH IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY BOROUGH
ORDER BY AccidentCount DESC

Which days of the week have the highest number of accidents?

SELECT 
  DATEPART(weekday, CRASH_DATE) AS DayOfWeek,
  COUNT(*) AS AccidentCount
FROM dbo.[NYC Accidents 2020]
GROUP BY DATEPART(weekday, CRASH_DATE)
ORDER BY AccidentCount DESC

Are there trends in the number of accidents over the months?

SELECT 
  DATEPART(year, CRASH_DATE) AS Year,
  DATEPART(month, CRASH_DATE) AS Month, 
  COUNT(*) AS AccidentCount
FROM dbo.[NYC Accidents 2020]
GROUP BY DATEPART(year, CRASH_DATE), DATEPART(month, CRASH_DATE)
ORDER BY Year, Month

This returned that January had the most accidents; this could be down to the snow / bad weather as a factor.

On which particular street were the most accidents reported? What does that represent as a % of all reported accidents?


WITH TotalAccidents AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCount
  FROM dbo.[NYC Accidents 2020]
  WHERE ON_STREET_NAME IS NOT NULL
),
StreetAccidents AS (
  SELECT 
    ON_STREET_NAME,
    COUNT(*) AS AccidentCount
  FROM dbo.[NYC Accidents 2020]
  WHERE ON_STREET_NAME IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY ON_STREET_NAME
)
SELECT TOP 1
  ON_STREET_NAME,
  AccidentCount,
  CAST(AccidentCount AS float) / TotalCount * 100 AS AccidentPercentage
FROM StreetAccidents,
     TotalAccidents
ORDER BY AccidentCount DESC

Comparing the % of total accidents by month. Can we work out or notice any seasonal patterns ?

WITH TotalAccidents AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalCount
  FROM dbo.[NYC Accidents 2020]
),
MonthlyAccidents AS (
  SELECT 
    DATEPART(month, CRASH_DATE) AS Month,
    COUNT(*) AS AccidentCount
  FROM dbo.[NYC Accidents 2020]
  GROUP BY DATEPART(month, CRASH_DATE)
)
SELECT 
  Month,
  AccidentCount,
  CAST(AccidentCount AS float) / TotalCount * 100 AS AccidentPercentage
FROM MonthlyAccidents, TotalAccidents
ORDER BY Month

How do accident rates vary by time of day or day of the week? This query uses two common table expressions (CTEs): `TimeOfDayAccidents` and `DayOfWeekAccidents`.

WITH TimeOfDayAccidents AS (
  SELECT 
    DATEPART(hour, CRASH_TIME) AS HourOfDay,
    COUNT(*) AS AccidentCount
  FROM dbo.[NYC Accidents 2020]
  GROUP BY DATEPART(hour, CRASH_TIME)
),
DayOfWeekAccidents AS (
  SELECT 
    DATEPART(weekday, CRASH_DATE) AS DayOfWeek,
    COUNT(*) AS AccidentCount
  FROM dbo.[NYC Accidents 2020]
  GROUP BY DATEPART(weekday, CRASH_DATE)
)
SELECT 
  'HourOfDay' AS GroupingType,
  HourOfDay AS GroupValue,
  AccidentCount
FROM TimeOfDayAccidents
UNION ALL
SELECT 
  'DayOfWeek' AS GroupingType,
  DayOfWeek AS GroupValue,
  AccidentCount
FROM DayOfWeekAccidents
ORDER BY GroupingType, GroupValue
