This files contains various queries about a dataset containing NYE resolutions, containing the topic, the state from which it was tweeted, the user gender, and the category.

From this dataset I wanted to find out which gender tweeted the most on NYE 2015:

SELECT user_gender, COUNT(*) AS NumOfTweets
FROM dbo.[New Years Tweets]
GROUP BY user_gender
ORDER BY NumOfTweets DESC;

I wanted to find out which state tweeted the most by querying the following:

SELECT tweet_state, COUNT(*) AS NumOfTweets
FROM dbo.[New Years Tweets]
GROUP BY tweet_state
ORDER BY NumOfTweets DESC;

Note: I could have added TOP to see the top 5, 10, or 15 states instead of all of them.

I wanted to find out which hashtags(#) were most popular:


SELECT TOP 3 SUBSTRING(tweet_text, CHARINDEX('#', tweet_text), CHARINDEX(' ', tweet_text + ' ', CHARINDEX('#', tweet_text)) - CHARINDEX('#', tweet_text)) AS Hashtag, COUNT(*) AS NumOfTweets
FROM dbo.[New Years Tweets]
GROUP BY SUBSTRING(tweet_text, CHARINDEX('#', tweet_text), CHARINDEX(' ', tweet_text + ' ', CHARINDEX('#', tweet_text)) - CHARINDEX('#', tweet_text))
ORDER BY NumOfTweets DESC;

I wanted to find out which category was tweeted most/ least often:

SELECT TOP 1 tweet_category AS MostTweetedCategory, COUNT(*) AS NumTweets
FROM dbo.[New Years Tweets]
WHERE tweet_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY tweet_category
ORDER BY NumTweets DESC

& for the least tweeted category:

SELECT TOP 1 tweet_category AS LeastTweetedCategory, COUNT(*) AS NumTweets
FROM dbo.[New Years Tweets]
WHERE tweet_category IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY tweet_category
ORDER BY NumTweets ASC;

What was the most popular hour of the day to tweet ? 

SELECT 
  DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(tweet_created), MONTH(tweet_created), DAY(tweet_created)) AS Date, 
  DATEPART(hour, tweet_created) AS Hour, 
  COUNT(DISTINCT tweet_text) AS NumResolutions
FROM dbo.[New Years Tweets]
GROUP BY DATEFROMPARTS(YEAR(tweet_created), MONTH(tweet_created), DAY(tweet_created)), DATEPART(hour, tweet_created)
ORDER BY NumResolutions DESC


How can we find out the average amount of tweets per state ?


SELECT tweet_state, COUNT(*) AS NumTweets, AVG(COUNT(*)) OVER () AS AvgTweetsPerState
FROM dbo.[New Years Tweets]
WHERE tweet_state IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY tweet_state
ORDER BY AvgTweetsPerState DESC



Finally, how many tweets are in this dataset total ?

SELECT COUNT(*) AS TotalTweets
FROM dbo.[New Years Tweets]
